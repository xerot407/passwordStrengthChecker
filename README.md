Overview
Password Master is a simple web application designed to help users generate secure passwords and evaluate the strength of their own passwords. It features a clean, user-friendly interface built with HTML and powered by Python on the backend. The app also maintains a history of generated passwords for easy reference and management.
This project is ideal for learning basic web development with Python and HTML, or as a starting point for building more advanced password management tools.
Features

Generate Secure Passwords: Click "Generate Password" to create a random, strong password.
Check Password Strength: Enter your own password and click "Check My Password" to assess its strength (e.g., weak, medium, strong based on criteria like length, character variety).
Password History: View a list of previously generated passwords with options to delete individual entries.
Simple UI: Responsive design with a dark theme for better usability.
Local Storage: Password history is stored locally (e.g., via browser storage or a simple backend database).

Technologies Used

Backend: Python (using Flask or a similar lightweight framework for handling requests).
Frontend: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., generating passwords, updating history).
Other: No external databases required; uses in-memory or file-based storage for simplicity.

Installation
To get Password Master running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
textgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-master.git
cd password-master

Set Up a Virtual Environment (recommended):
textpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:
If using Flask or similar, install via pip:
textpip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: Create a requirements.txt file with dependencies like Flask if not already present.)
Run the Application:
textpython app.py  # Or the name of your main Python file
The app will start a local server (usually at http://127.0.0.1:5000/).
Open in Browser:
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or the port specified) in your web browser.

Usage

Generate a Password:

Click the "Generate Password" button.
A new secure password will appear in the input field and be added to the history list.


Check Your Password:

Enter a password in the input field.
Click "Check My Password".
The app will display feedback on the password's strength (implement logic in Python/JS to evaluate based on length, uppercase/lowercase, numbers, symbols).


Manage History:

View past passwords in the "Password History" section.
Click the trash icon next to a password to delete it.



Note: Passwords are generated randomly. Customize the generation logic in the code for specific requirements (e.g., length, character sets).
